<p>Welcome to my blog on github.io! This is the place where I intend to write about interesting aspects of the the technical world. Or, to be more precise, things which I find interesting. I chose to use the github pages because they provide a cool domain and it implies a somewhat technical relatedness.</p>
<p>I am just writing up this article quickly and right now I guess the most important things to know for you is that this blog is open-source! Actually I created it for the purpose of getting more fluent in Angular-development and because I refused to use something big and unflexible such as Jekyll. The system is called <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/MrShoenel/stab">stab</a></em></strong> which stands for <strong>Static Tidy Angular Blog</strong>. It&apos;s basically an offline blogging platform that will create a very lightweight, lazy loading and extensible static blog that you can deploy to any webhost because it doesn&apos;t require server-side scripting (makes it perfect for github-pages).</p>
<p>Anyhow, my 2nd intention behind blogging was actually to write an article or more of a proposal for a substitute for IPv6 (which I personally think is a really bad approach). In the meantime, I actually created <a stab-ref="tech/proposal-for-new-internet-protocol-ip64">that post</a>. So I am going to use this blog to express my personal opinions about certain topics, so it has more of an FYI-character.</p>
