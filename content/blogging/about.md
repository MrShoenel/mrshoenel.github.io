<!--#### Non-optional (required) tags -->
<!--
	Date.parse() compatible date or 'auto' if you want to have
	it generated by looking at the file's last modification time.
	This meta-tag will be put into the document's head.
-->
<div id="meta">
<meta name="created" content="Sun Dec 06 2015 23:55:35 GMT+0100" />
<meta name="lastmodified" content="auto" />
<!--
	The article's name is required as well. If you do not
	provide a name this file's name will be used.
-->
<meta name="title" content="About" />
<!--
	We're also gonna use that as the article's ID. You
	might leave the URL empty so it will get auto-generated
	from the title, but be careful: If the title changes, so
	will the URL (think of SEO).
	The URL may also contain an arbitrary relative path that
	can be used then for organizing articles into categories.
-->
<meta name="urlname" content="about" />




<!-- #### Optional/arbitrary tags below  -->
<!--
	Now the following tags are fully arbitrary and depend on
	your needs or wheter your template makes any use of them.
-->
<meta name="subtitle" content="About me, this blog and why it's here" />

<!--
	If present, the next tags will be used 1-to-1 in the
	head-section of the current document:
-->
<meta name="author" content="sebastian">
<meta name="description" content="This is the about page of my blog." />
<meta name="keywords" content="blog" />

<!-- Useful for tagging articles: -->
<meta name="displayat" content="topnav" />
<!-- Used to override the designated background image: -->
<!--<meta name="bgimage" content="images/contact-bg.jpg" />-->

Welcome to my blog on github.io! This is the place where I intend to write about interesting aspects of the the technical world. Or, to be more precise, things which I find interesting. I chose to use the github pages because they provide a cool domain and it implies a somewhat technical relatedness.

I am just writing up this article quickly and right now I guess the most important things to know for you is that this blog is open-source! Actually I created it for the purpose of getting more fluent in Angular-development and because I refused to use something big and unflexible such as Jekyll. The system is called ***[stab](https://github.com/MrShoenel/stab)*** which stands for **Static Tidy Angular Blog**. It's basically an offline blogging platform that will create a very lightweight, lazy loading and extensible static blog that you can deploy to any webhost because it doesn't require server-side scripting (makes it perfect for github-pages).

Anyhow, my 2nd intention behind blogging was actually to write an article or more of a proposal for a substitute for IPv6 (which I personally think is a really bad approach). In the meantime, I actually created <a stab-ref="tech/proposal-for-new-internet-protocol-ip64">that post</a>. So I am going to use this blog to express my personal opinions about certain topics, so it has more of an FYI-character.
