<article>
<p>This article presents an idea for a new extended Internet Protocol which is settled somewhere between <em>IPv4</em> and <em>IPv6</em>. I actually like to call it <strong>IP64</strong> as it implies a version independency (or: not following the other versions) and hints the 64-bit semantics of that addressing scheme (more about this below). This whole idea is something I continuously was thinking about from time to time and now I guess it&apos;s time to write something of that down. Why I feel it has to be written down? Because it&apos;s about (damn) time: IPv6 is being more and more adopted on a compulsory basis and our global IPv4 pool is running out of addresses.</p>

<p>I think it is okay to say that IPv6 is only slowly adopted and everyone tries to hold on to their IPv4 addresses for as long as possible. Of the top of my head, I can think of several reasons for IPv6&apos;s absent success, below I will start a list of reasons that will probably grow whenever I have the feeling something is missing. However, I still think that during the next decade we will see a great majority of connected devices switch over to IPv6, although most of them would have liked to stick with IPv4. I want to put out this article so that in the end no one can claim to be unsatisfied with IPv6, having ignored the thoughts expressed here. Think of what I write here as an open FYI-letter which I will be extending from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="why-isn-t-ipv6-the-prevalent-internet-protocol-yet-">Why isn&apos;t IPv6 the prevalent Internet Protocol yet?</h3>
<p>The IPv4 pool can considered to be empty. IPv6&apos;s killer argument was, is and will be the vast size of its address pool. IPv4 provided approx. <em>2^32</em> addresses (about 4.3 billion) whereas IPv6 provides <em>2^96</em> times that amount (~3.4e38). So, if one resource is depleted and the next is ready to go, why haven&apos;t we switched over long ago? Well, there are some obvious reasons (legacy code/hardware etc.), but I like to think of other reasons as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>IPv6 and IPv4 are incompatible. Have you ever seen those nice <em>6to4</em> &amp; <em>6in4</em> tunnels and Teredo-interfaces? Those are necessary because v4 and v6 can <em>co-exist</em>, but <em>not co-operate</em>. This I consider a huge show stopper.</li>
<li>When you&apos;re accustomed to IPv4 you will notice the ugliness of v6 addresses. v4 addresses were easy to read and to remember; v6, however, uses a hexadecimal notation. I see multiple issues with that:<ul>
<li>Very long addresses: Eight groups of four hexadecimals <em>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</em> is hard to read. Yes, there is a shortcut-notation. No, I don&apos;t like it.</li>
<li>The colon is not suitable for separating groups of the address. By not suitable I mean that human readers might find that awkward.</li>
<li>Hexadecimal notation cannot be used <em>&quot;straight away&quot;</em>: You probably will have to re-base the address into another system before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have been re-inventing the wheel partially for IPv6. Numerous protocols have a separate <em>v6</em>-version that became necessary. These new protocols haven&apos;t been used in practice for as long as we used their <em>v4</em>-pendants. I honestly think that if we would switch to v6 now entirely, it would unveil countless compatibility issues.</li>
<li>Numerous privacy issues. We liked having private address-spaces, a layered network and not every device on one end to be able to communicate with every other device on the other end. If we wanted that, we implemented a route using IPv4. IPv6 provides a feature to randomize client-addresses, but this does not satisfy our requirements.</li>
<li><em>.. more will be added later ..</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-will-ip64-then-be-better-">How will IP64 then be better?</h2>
<p>I honestly do not know if <em>IP64</em> as I suggest it would be able to displace IPv6, but this is what I would aim for. A sane replacement uniting the well-established IPv4 and <em>some</em> features of IPv6, such as Multicasting.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-would-propose-for-ip64">What I would propose for IP64</h3>
<p>As in the previous section, I would like to start a living list with ideas which should be incorporated into IP64.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>64 bit wide address space</strong>:<ul>
<li>Yes, I figure that this will be enough. It is 4.3 billion times what we have right now (1.8e19). That means that every human being would be able to roughly connect 2 billion devices to the public IP64 Internet. In informatics we learn that if something runs out of space, the first thing to do is to double its size. With IPv6, we multiplied the size of the address pool with <strong>2^96</strong> instead of doubling (<strong>x2</strong>) it. IP64 still multiplies it with <strong>2^32</strong>. Theoretically speaking, I am 100% sure that if this space would be depleted, we would have other, far more serious problems to solve first. Also, the idea IP64 is based on, could be extended to sth. like IP80 or IP96 for that matter, if someone really thinks it won&apos;t be enough. It is actually a feature of IP64 to be extendable in that way (more below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Re-using and keeping existing addresses</strong>:<ul>
<li>I guess that&apos;d be IP64&apos;s killer argument. We keep existing allocations and subnets. How will that work:<ul>
<li>An IP64 address is exactly twice as long as an IPv4 address: <strong>1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8</strong></li>
<li>Likely, subnet-masks will be in the range from 0-64 bits; we keep the <em>same</em> notation: <strong>1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8/52</strong></li>
<li>We keep all known and assigned addresses by defining them to be within <strong>0.0.0.0.v.w.x.y/z</strong> (or another constant prefix for the first four octects), we also keep the existing subnet-mask.<ul>
<li>We might come up with a shortcut-notation known from IPv6 for our <em>old</em> IPv4 addresses: If the prefix/padding was <em>0.0.0.0</em>, we could write an old old address like <em>0:1.2.3.4/[0-32]</em> or even not display the first four octets at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interopability</strong>:<ul>
<li>An IPv4 packet can be extended to hold 64-bit IP addresses instead. The first four bits are designated to the version. If IP64 is read from that range, IP addresses are interpreted as being  64 bits long; 32 bits, otherwise. Later, we could simplify that by always only using IP64 addresses and pad addresses from the IPv4 space with four octets in the beginning which are zero.<ul>
<li>IP64 packets are a superset of IPv4 packets. Hence, an IP64 address which is actually an IPv4 address can be <strong>encapsulated</strong> in an IPv4 packet.</li>
<li>This way, our existing infrastructure stays routable while we extend it with IP64-capable hard- and software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That way, we do not require tunneling. Old IPv4 addresses are now prefixed/padded with 0.0.0.0. This way, IPv4 and IP64 can <strong>co-exist</strong> and <strong>co-operate peacefully</strong>. This way IP64 can be seen as an extension <em>on top of</em> IPv4.</li>
<li>This should be easily implementable and can be added to existing solutions in hard- or software.<center>

<p>I will soon update this article because I know that I forgot lots of things as of now that I wanted to add. I am still releasing this article now <em>as is</em> because I figure better now than later.</p>
<p>Also, I will add Github-based comments to this blog and article. If, in the meantime, you have any comments to this, please visit my Github-profile and write to the email address there.</p>
